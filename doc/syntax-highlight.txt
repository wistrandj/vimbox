There are two folders for syntax highlighting:

    - ./syntax/*.vim
    - ./after/syntax/*.vim

See :h mysyntaxfile for making own syntax plugins.

A syntax plugin sets b:current_syntax variable, which prevents
later plugins from loading syntax.

Note: Some after/syntax files use the variable g:no_syntax. Not
sure if this is a common variable in VIM or something from vimbox.
