Mystuff is just .vimrc in the form of a plugin to keep the rc file as clean as
possible. It doesn't do anything in particular and it's a collection of random
settings, mappings, functions and syntax files.

The plugin was not intended to be published: it doesn't have proper
documentation or even descriptive comments. However if you dig in to the source
code you may find something useful.

Install
=======

Use should not use Mystuff as it is but you should build your own .vimrc file or
plugin. If you want to try it, copy Mystuff/ to your Pathogen's bundle folder
and create a symbolic link from ~/.vimrc to ~/.vim/bundle/mystuff/vimrc.
