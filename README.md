# VimBox-rc

VimBox-rc is a plugin of miscellaneous commands and mappings that are too small
to be separate plugins. It's not intended for public use and therefore it has
hardly any documentation. But if you find any interesting ideas in VimBox-rc
then feel free to copy those bits and pieces into your own vimrc.

# Install

Copy the project into bundle/ directory provided by your plugin manager (Vundle,
Pathogen) and make a symlink from vimrc to ~/.vimrc.

```
    cd ~/.vim/bundle
    git clone [url]
    ln -s VimBox-rc/vimrc ~/.vimrc
```
